# Flashing

---

## What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| **The board** | A classic ESP32 with 4 MB of flash - what the common 32×8 clocks use - or an ESP32-S3 board. |
| **A USB data cable** | Charge-only cables never show up as a serial port. |
| **A browser, or `esptool`** | Chrome, Edge or Opera on a desktop can do the whole flash themselves. Everything else needs `pip install esptool`. |

Building the firmware yourself instead needs PlatformIO, Python and Node.js - that path is
[Building from source](../advanced/building.md).

The commands below spell the esptool subcommands `read_flash`, `write_flash`, `erase_flash` and
`flash_id`. esptool 5 spells them with hyphens - `read-flash` and so on - and prints a warning for
the underscore form.

## 1. Flash it from your browser

Chrome, Edge or Opera on a desktop. Nothing to install:

<div id="awtrix-flasher"></div>
<script type="module" src="../../assets/awtrix-flasher.js"></script>

Pick your board's port when the browser asks. It detects the chip, the flash size and - on an S3 -
whether the PSRAM is quad or octal, then writes the newest release for it.

**Fresh install** is the first time you put AWTRIX NG on a board. It clears settings, Wi-Fi
credentials, icons, melodies, palettes and scripts, and the device comes up as its own access
point - that is [First boot](first-boot.md).

**Update AWTRIX NG** is for a board that already runs it. Everything on it stays, and it comes
back on your Wi-Fi on the new version. Without a cable, the same update runs
[over the web UI](../guides/updating.md).

---

## 2. Back up what is on the chip

Flashing overwrites everything, including the firmware the device came with. Take the copy before
you flash, not after - this needs esptool even if the flash itself did not.

```bash
python -m esptool --chip esp32 --port COM5 --baud 921600 read_flash 0x0 0x400000 tc001-stock-4mb.bin
```

* `--port` is `COM5` on Windows, `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux, `/dev/cu.usbserial-*` on macOS.
* It takes about a minute. If it stalls or errors, retry with `--baud 115200`.
* The file must be exactly 4,194,304 bytes. Anything shorter is a failed read, not a backup.

To go back to it later, write the same file to offset 0:

```bash
python -m esptool --chip esp32 --port COM5 --baud 460800 write_flash 0x0 tc001-stock-4mb.bin
```

That restores the original firmware **and** everything that was stored on it, Wi-Fi credentials
included.

## 3. Pick your image

The manual route, for a browser without Web Serial or a board the flasher refuses.

Download `usb-awtrix-ng.zip` from the
[releases page](https://github.com/Blueforcer/awtrix-ng/releases) and unpack it. It holds one
image per board and flash size:

| File | For |
|---|---|
| `usb-awtrix-ng-4mb.bin` | 4 MB ESP32 boards, the Ulanzi TC001 among them |
| `usb-awtrix-ng-8mb.bin`, `usb-awtrix-ng-16mb.bin` | ESP32 boards with more flash |
| `usb-awtrix-ng-s3-octal-*.bin` | ESP32-S3 boards - start here |
| `usb-awtrix-ng-s3-quad-*.bin` | ESP32-S3 boards whose PSRAM the one above does not find |

Take the one matching your board's flash size. If you are unsure how much it has, ask the chip:

```bash
python -m esptool --port COM5 flash_id
```

### Which of the two S3 images

An S3 reaches its PSRAM over one of two wirings, quad or octal, and the image has to match. Nothing
printed on the board tells you reliably which one it is: `R8` and `R2` describe the size, sellers
use them loosely, and a board can carry its PSRAM as a separate chip that no tool sees from outside.

So do not guess - **write the `-octal-` image first**. It starts on every S3, with or without PSRAM,
and then the device itself answers the question: open its page and look at **PSRAM**.

| What the device shows | What it means |
|---|---|
| A size, usually 8 MB | Right image, nothing more to do |
| `none`, and your board has no PSRAM | Right image. No radio on this board, that is the hardware |
| `none`, but your board is advertised with PSRAM | It is wired quad - write the `-quad-` image |

!!! warning "Only in that order"
    The `-quad-` image does not start at all on a board that is not quad - the panel stays dark
    until you write the other one over USB. The `-octal-` image always starts, at worst without
    PSRAM. That is why it goes first.

The `firmware-awtrix-ng*.bin` assets on the same page are **not** for this - they are for
[updating a device](../guides/updating.md) that already runs AWTRIX NG.

Older releases carried these images under other names: loose files on the releases page rather
than one zip up to v1.0.15, with the S3 one called `usb-awtrix-ng-s3-<size>.bin` before it named
its PSRAM type, and `factory-awtrix-ng-<size>.bin` up to v1.0.14. Same images.

## 4. Flash it with esptool

```bash
python -m esptool --chip esp32 --port COM5 --baud 460800 write_flash 0x0 usb-awtrix-ng-4mb.bin
```

Use `--chip esp32s3` for an S3 board. When it finishes it prints `Hash of data verified.` If it
never gets that far, [When it goes wrong](#when-it-goes-wrong) lists what usually stops it.

!!! warning "Do not raise the baud rate to 921600"
    A write at 921600 aborts partway on the USB-serial bridge a TC001 uses. The chip has been
    erased by then, so it is left half-written and will not boot. Repeat the write at
    `--baud 460800`.

What this does to AWTRIX:

* **Settings and Wi-Fi credentials are erased.** It comes up as its own access point - continue at
  [First boot](first-boot.md).
* **Files you uploaded may or may not survive.** Icons, melodies, palettes and scripts live in a
  separate area that the image does not overwrite, but a firmware whose storage area sits
  elsewhere will not find them. Download anything you care about first, through the web UI, or
  list what's on the device with [`GET /api/v1/files`](../reference/http.md#get-apiv1files) and
  fetch each file from its `/ICONS/`, `/MELODIES/` or `/PALETTES/` path.

For a genuinely blank chip, erase before you write:

```bash
python -m esptool --chip esp32 --port COM5 erase_flash
```

---

## 5. Watch it boot

```bash
pio device monitor
```

Any serial monitor at **115200 baud** does. The line you are looking for is:

```text
boot: AWTRIX NG 1.0.12 on ESP32
```

Freshly flashed, AWTRIX has no Wi-Fi credentials, so after about 15 seconds it opens an access
point - that is [First boot](first-boot.md). On later boots, once it joins your network, it
scrolls `AWTRIX   <ip>` across the matrix in rainbow colours, so you can read the web UI's
address off the panel without a cable.

---

## 6. Set your wiring

A fresh flash always comes up on the ESP32 default pin map, the wiring of the common 32×8 clocks.
If that is your board, you are done - continue to [First boot](first-boot.md).

Anything else needs its GPIO map set once, in the web UI under **System → GPIO**. The map is
stored on AWTRIX and takes effect after a reboot. Send the **whole** map at once: changing one
pin on its own is usually rejected for colliding with another.

Presets for both boards, the pins each field accepts, and how to recover from a map you regret are
in [GPIO & boards](../reference/gpio.md).

## When it goes wrong

| Symptom | What to check |
|---|---|
| **No serial port found** | A charge-only USB cable, or a missing driver for your board's USB-to-serial bridge. The port has to exist before anything can talk to it. |
| **The write aborts partway** | Lower the baud rate - `--baud 115200` completes where 460800 does not. The chip is left unbootable until a write succeeds, so just repeat it. |
| **`A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect`** | Some boards need the boot button held while the tool connects. On a TC001 that is not required; on a DIY board it often is. |
| **`Unable to verify flash chip connection`**, and the reason differs every attempt | esptool speeds the port up partway through connecting, and not every USB-to-serial bridge survives that. Add `--no-stub` to the command: it holds one speed the whole way, which is slower but gets through. The browser flasher retries that way on its own. |
| **It beeps continuously while flashing** | Expected, and not a fault. The buzzer sits on GPIO 15, which is also MTDO - a strapping pin whose internal pull-up is on after every reset - and the buzzer is active high. So the line is held at its active level for as long as the chip sits in download mode, where no firmware runs to pull it low. It stops when the new firmware boots. Nothing in software can silence the download-mode window; a shorter write is the only lever. |
| **Boots, but the panel stays dark** | The wrong matrix pin for your hardware, or brightness at 0. |
| **Boots, but the hardware misbehaves** | Watch the serial log. A stored pin map the chip cannot use is announced there, and AWTRIX falls back to the defaults for its chip. |
