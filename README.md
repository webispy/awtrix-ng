**256-1024 pixels on your desk, and you decide what they say.**

*The direct successor to the well-known AWTRIX 3 - rewritten from scratch.*

Push a number from Home Assistant, a shell script or anything that speaks HTTP and MQTT -
or skip the middleman entirely and **run your app on the device itself.**

> **This is the `serial-control` branch.** On top of upstream AWTRIX NG it adds a USB serial command
> and framebuffer channel, so a host can drive the panel *and* query its sensors, buttons and
> display over the cable with no network at all — see
> [`docs/reference/serial.md`](docs/reference/serial.md). It is the firmware half of a three-part
> system: [`pixelwire`](https://github.com/webispy/pixelwire) is a host daemon that owns the serial
> port and composites layers onto the panel, and
> [`awtrix-agents`](https://github.com/webispy/awtrix-agents) is a Claude Code / Codex plugin that
> shows coding-agent session state on the panel through pixelwire.

AWTRIX NG turns an inexpensive LED-matrix clock into a small networked screen for your home. It
shows time, date, temperature, humidity and battery out of the box, and then does whatever you
tell it - scroll a message, draw a chart, play a melody, flash an alert when the doorbell rings.

### Tell it something

```bash
curl -X POST http://awtrix-ng.local/api/v1/notifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Hello world","textColor":"#FF0000"}'
```

**Hello world** scrolls across the panel in red. That is the whole learning curve. Anything that
speaks HTTP or MQTT can do the same - Home Assistant, Node-RED, a shell script, a cron job.

### Or let it think for itself

Paste a program into the web UI and it runs **on the clock**. No compiler, no re-flash, no server
on your LAN keeping it alive.

```berry
class Dashboard
  var level

  def loop()                     # keeps working, even off screen
    self.level = (self.level + 7) % 101
  end

  def draw()                     # ~40×/s while you are on screen
    effect("PlasmaCloud", {"speed": 0.3, "palette": "Ocean"})
    progress(self.level, 0x00FF00, 0x101010)
    ramp_text(1, 6, "NET", [0x00FFAA, 0x0066FF])
  end
end

return Dashboard()
```

Save it, and it joins the rotation like any other app. Scripts fetch over HTTP, talk MQTT, keep
state across reboots and paint with the firmware's full visual vocabulary. A crashing script goes
red and stays in its own frame - everything else keeps running.

## ✨ What you get

- ⚡ **Apps that run on the device** - edited in the browser, surviving reboots
- 🎨 **Real graphics** - scrolling colored text, icons, charts, background effects, weather overlays
- 📥 **Push from anywhere** - screens into the rotation, or a one-shot alert that cuts in front
- 🏠 **Home Assistant** - MQTT auto-discovery, no YAML
- 🌡️ **Sensors** - auto-detected temperature/humidity, auto-brightness, battery
- 🔊 **Sound** - RTTTL melodies through the buzzer or a DFPlayer
- 🖥️ **Web UI on the device** - live matrix preview, script editor, every setting. No app, no cloud
- ⚙️ **One image, any board** - pins are settings, not a build flavour

## 🚀 Get going

1. **Flash** - open the [browser flasher](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix-ng/getting-started/flashing/) in Chrome, Edge or Opera. Nothing to install.
2. **Wi-Fi** - the device opens its own access point on first boot and the setup page pops up by itself.
3. **Say hello** - send the `curl` above to `awtrix-ng.local`, then open `http://awtrix-ng.local/` and look around.


> **Coming from AWTRIX 3?** This is a from-scratch rewrite with its own **API v1**. Nothing carries
> over and v3 integrations must be reworked. Set the device up fresh.

## 🧩 Hardware & source

Any 32(-128)×8 WS2812-style panel: a commercial clock, an AWTRIX 2 conversion or your own build - same
image, pins set in the web UI. ESP32 and ESP32-S3.

```bash
pio run  -e awtrix        # build + flash
pio run  -e native_sim    # the whole firmware on your computer, no hardware needed
```

The simulator runs the real thing, script engine and editor included - the fastest way to try this
without buying anything.

**Everything else** - every endpoint, setting and payload field - lives in the
**[documentation](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix-ng/)**.
